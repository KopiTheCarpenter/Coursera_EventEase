# Copilot Assistance Summary
Throughout the development of the EventEase app, Microsoft Copilot played a central role in accelerating the workflow and ensuring best practices were followed:
* Foundational Component Creation: Copilot generated the initial EventCard.razor component with fields for event name, date, and location. It also suggested two-way data binding syntax, allowing event details to be dynamically displayed and edited.
* Routing Setup and Debugging: Copilot guided the configuration of routing in App.razor and navigation links in NavMenu.razor. When errors occurred with invalid paths, Copilot provided fixes to gracefully handle “Not Found” scenarios.
* Optimization and Validation: Copilot identified missing input validation in the Event model and suggested `[Required]` and `[StringLength]` attributes. It also optimized routing logic and improved performance when handling larger event datasets.
* Advanced Features Implementation: Copilot assisted in building the `Register.razor` page with validation, adding `UserSession.cs` for state management, and creating Attendance.razor to track event participation. It also helped refine the registration flow to support both direct event registration `/register/{eventId}` and general registration with a dropdown.
* Styling and User Experience: Copilot suggested CSS improvements in app.css to make forms and attendance lists more user-friendly, ensuring the interface was polished for deployment.
* Deployment Readiness: Copilot provided guidance on cleaning up dependencies, structuring services, and preparing the app for production, ensuring the codebase is maintainable and ready to publish.
